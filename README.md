McDonald's Store Reviews Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project aims to conduct an aspect-based sentiment analysis on a dataset of McDonald's store reviews. Our goal is to identify key terms that describe extremely positive and negative ratings. Additionally, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a review based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

Objectives
To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to understand the distribution of ratings and common words or phrases.
To perform aspect-based sentiment analysis on the reviews to identify the specific aspects of the service that customers are praising or complaining about.
To identify key terms and phrases that are most commonly associated with extremely positive (5-star) and extremely negative (1-star) ratings.
To develop a predictive model that uses sentiment analysis to predict the rating of a review.
